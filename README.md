# Odin Recipes

## Project Overview

Odin Recipes is a beginner-level website built as part of the Odin Project Foundations course.
The goal of this project is to practice HTML skills by creating a simple recipe website
with multiple pages linking to different recipes.

This project focuses on structure and content, not styling. CSS and JavaScript will be
added in future iterations to enhance the website.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Writing semantic HTML (headings, paragraphs, lists)
- Linking multiple pages together
- Adding images and formatting content
- Organizing project files and folders
- Using Git and GitHub for version control

## Future Improvements

- Add CSS to style the website and make it visually appealing
- Add JavaScript to make the website interactive
- Expand the recipe collection and improve navigation

## Notes

- This project will be revisited later to improve styling and functionality.
